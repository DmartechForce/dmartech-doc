The interactive center provides an editor creation page containing rich style templates, with five modules on the left: style area, template area, layout tools, associated forms and preview.&#x20;

#### Save\Publish Page

After the page is edited, click Save and Next to enter the Save or Publish page. Whether the page can be published to the applet depends on whether the applet is authorized to bind and audited successfully.

&#x20;When the applet is not bound or not approved, the page only supports saving.

After you click Save, you will return to the main page of Interaction Center, and the page you have created successfully will be in the home page list in draft status; after you click Publish, the applet code and applet link of the exclusive page will be generated. The sharing method can then be placed in the channels you want to place.

#### Online\Offline Page

A published page is a live page. When your marketing campaign is over and you no longer need a page visible on the applet side, you can take down the page.&#x20;

You can find the page you need to take down in the main list of Interaction Center, find the Offline button in More Actions, click it and confirm it twice, then you can take down the page successfully. The page will no longer be displayed in the applet after being taken offline.

#### Delete Page

Deleting a page only supports operations on pages with draft status. So when you need to delete a published page, you need to take the published page offline first, then find the Delete button in More Operations, click and confirm twice, then the page will be deleted successfully. All the statistics of the deleted page will be deleted.

For the authorization and binding of the applet, please check in the \[Enterprise Settings] content.
