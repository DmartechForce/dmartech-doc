# Meta Data

User attributes, events, and event attributes can be defined in the Meta data module. User attributes refer to various aspects information of contacts, such as name, gender, age, etc. These information can be entered when uploading or creating a contact, or obtained and imported by Dmartech when the contact submitting the form. The behavior of the contacts is recorded by events, and all behaviors and actions can be viewed in the Contact dynamic info in the Contact detail page. There are some common preset events in Dmartech. The platform will capture some contacts behavior events by default. It also supports custom events for event tracking or other event records of background transmission. There is no limit to the number of created custom events.

### Customize Contact Attributes

All contact data fields need to be defined in the User properties page first before importing to the platform, otherwise the data will not be imported to the platform (the form fields also need to be created in the Meta data).&#x20;

* Type: Choose one of the four types: string, integer, date and decimal.&#x20;
* Length: Set the field length according to the Type.&#x20;
* Key identify: The platform will merge data record according to the primary key attributes.

Therefore, it is necessary to set the attribute that can represent the contactsâ€™ identity as the primary key, such as mobile, email, etc. The primary key is unique. Attributes with repeated values cannot be defined as primary keys.&#x20;
