# Tag Management

The tag can mark the characteristics of the contact and is used to form a user portrait of the contact. Tags can be used as the latitude of division of contacts. Tagging contacts is a common operation in marketing. The reasonable use of tags can describe the 360-degree user portrait. The tags are directly tagged on the contact, which can provide a more in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of the contact. 

We introduced follower tags in WeChat Management. Follower tags are the tags which are only set for WeChat followers. There are two types of tag in Dmartech: follower tags and contact tags. You can view the contact tags in Data center &gt; Data mgt &gt; Tag mgt, which is applicable to all contacts.

### Create a tag 

**Step 1**Choose Data center &gt; Tag mgt from the main menu. Click"Add label" to enter the Name in the Add label explorer. Click "Save" to complete creating the tag. After the tag is added, it can be directly used as a static tag, or you can add a rule to the tag as a smart tag.

 **Do not add rules \(equivalent to static tags\)**

 Do not add rules to the tag after the tag is created. You can manually add a tag in the Contact detail page, or select a tag when importing/ creating contacts. You can also use Add tag or Remove tag to add or delete tags to contacts when creating a journey. 

**Add rules \(equivalent to smart tags\)** 

**Step 2** Click on the created tag and set rules of the tag. Add a filter criterion about contacts attributes.

**Step 3** After setting the filter criteria, click"Add label" if you need to add this tag for the contacts that meet the filter criteria, click "Delete label" if you need to remove this tag for the contacts that meet the filter criteria. 

**Step 4** Dmartech will automatically add or remove the tag for contacts that meet the filter criteria. The tagging progress will be displayed in the tag box after adding the rule. You can also manually click to view the number of the contacts which are tagged.

In addition to tagging contacts through adding rules, you can also set tags by adding related controls such as Add Tag and Remove Tag in the marketing journey, or creating a QR code with parameters that can be tagged after scanning the QR code.
